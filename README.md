# Card Game

This is a card game. The rules are simple. You must guess on what the next card will be - is it higher, lower or the same?
Points are awarded when you guess right. If you guess wrong, GAME OVER.

## How to run the game

```console
$ cd card-game
/card-game $ composer install
/card-game $ npm install

/card-game $ npm run dev
```
