# Card Game

This is a card game. The rules are simple. You must guess on what the next card will be - is it higher, lower or the same?
Points are awarded when you guess right. If you guess wrong, GAME OVER.

## How to run the game

```console
$ cd card-game
$ composer install
$ npm install
$ php artisan run:serve
$ npm run dev
```

The game should now be accessible at `127.0.0.1:8000`!
